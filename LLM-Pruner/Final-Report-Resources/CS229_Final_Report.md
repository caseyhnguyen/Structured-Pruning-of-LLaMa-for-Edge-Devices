## Abstract

This project implements and extends the Sheared LLaMA approach to structured pruning for the LLaMA 3.1 8B model, with the goal of creating efficient language models suitable for edge deployment. We adapt the pruning methodology to handle LLaMA 3.1's unique architectural features, particularly its Grouped Query Attention (GQA) mechanism and larger intermediate dimensions. Our implementation achieves significant model size reduction while maintaining model performance through careful constraint optimization and continued pre-training.

## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This project addresses this challenge by implementing structured pruning techniques specifically designed for LLaMA 3.1 8B, building upon the Sheared LLaMA approach while adapting it to handle architectural differences.

### 1.1 Background

Recent advances in LLM architectures have introduced features like Grouped Query Attention (GQA) to improve efficiency. LLaMA 3.1 8B employs GQA with a ratio of 4:1 between query heads and key/value heads, resulting in 32 query heads sharing 8 key/value heads. This architectural choice presents unique challenges for structured pruning, as the grouped structure must be preserved to maintain model functionality.

### 1.2 Related Work

Previous approaches to LLM compression include:
1. **Unstructured Pruning**: Removes individual weights based on importance scores
   - Advantages: Fine-grained control
   - Disadvantages: Limited hardware acceleration
   
2. **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfers knowledge from large to small models
   - Advantages: Preserves general knowledge
   - Disadvantages: Requires extensive training

3. **Structured Pruning**: Removes entire structural components
   - Advantages: Hardware-friendly, maintains architectural properties
   - Disadvantages: Coarser granularity

Our work builds upon structured pruning, specifically extending the Sheared LLaMA approach to handle GQA and larger intermediate dimensions.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Problem Formulation

Let θ denote the parameters of an LLM. The structured pruning problem can be formulated as:

```
min_θ,z L(θ,z)
s.t. ||z_layer||_0 ≤ k_layer
    ||z_head||_0 ≤ k_head
    ||z_hidden||_0 ≤ k_hidden
    ||z_int||_0 ≤ k_int
```

where:
- L(θ,z) is the language modeling loss
- z = {z_layer, z_head, z_hidden, z_int} are binary masks
- k_* are target sparsity constraints

### 2.2 Hard Concrete Distribution

To enable gradient-based optimization of discrete masks, we use the hard concrete distribution:

```
s = sigmoid((log α + log(u) - log(1-u))/β)
z = min(1, max(0, s))
```

where:
- α is the learnable parameter
- u ~ Uniform(0,1)
- β is the temperature parameter
- z is the binary mask

The probability of sampling z=1 is given by:

```
P(z=1) = sigmoid(log α/β)
```

### 2.3 Constrained Optimization

We reformulate the constrained optimization using Lagrange multipliers:

```
L_total = L(θ,z) + Σ_j λ_j(||z_j||_0 - k_j) + Σ_j φ_j(||z_j||_0 - k_j)²
```

where:
- λ_j are Lagrange multipliers
- φ_j are quadratic penalty coefficients
- j ∈ {layer, head, hidden, int}

## 3. Architecture-Specific Considerations

### 3.1 Grouped Query Attention

GQA introduces structural dependencies between attention heads. For n query heads sharing m key/value heads (where n > m), the attention computation is:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/√d)V

where:
Q ∈ R^{b×h×n×d}  # Query
K ∈ R^{b×h×m×d}  # Key
V ∈ R^{b×h×m×d}  # Value
```

Our pruning strategy must maintain this grouped structure by:
1. Identifying groups of query heads sharing key/value heads
2. Ensuring consistent pruning within groups
3. Preserving the 4:1 ratio between query and key/value heads

### 3.2 Intermediate Dimension Handling

LLaMA 3.1's larger intermediate dimensions (14336 vs 11008) affect the feed-forward network:

```
FFN(x) = W_2(act(W_1x) ⊗ W_3x)

where:
W_1, W_3 ∈ R^{d_ff×d_model}
W_2 ∈ R^{d_model×d_ff}
d_ff = 14336
d_model = 4096
```

Our pruning approach handles this by:
1. Joint optimization of W_1 and W_3 pruning
2. Maintaining balanced pruning across layers
3. Considering activation patterns in pruning decisions

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Mask Implementation

The base mask class implements the hard concrete sampling:

```python
class StructuredPruningMask(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, size, init_value=0.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.log_alpha = nn.Parameter(torch.full(size, init_value))
        self.concrete = HardConcreteDistribution()
        
    def forward(self, temperature=1.0):
        return self.concrete.sample(self.log_alpha, temperature)
```

GQA-aware head pruning is implemented as:

```python
class HeadMask(StructuredPruningMask):
    def forward(self, temperature=1.0):
        mask = super().forward(temperature)
        if self.num_kv_heads is not None:
            # Reshape to (layers, kv_heads, queries_per_kv)
            heads_per_kv = mask.size(1) // self.num_kv_heads
            mask = mask.view(mask.size(0), self.num_kv_heads, heads_per_kv)
            # Average across queries sharing same kv head
            mask = mask.mean(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
            # Expand back to all query heads
            mask = mask.expand(-1, -1, heads_per_kv)
            mask = mask.reshape(mask.size(0), -1)
        return mask
```

### 4.2 Optimization Algorithm

The training process follows Algorithm 1:

```
Algorithm 1: Structured Pruning with GQA Support
Input: Model θ, target sparsities k_j, learning rate η
Initialize: Masks z_j, Lagrange multipliers λ_j
for epoch = 1 to N do
    for batch in DataLoader do
        # Forward pass with mask sampling
        z = sample_masks(temperature)
        loss = compute_loss(θ, z, batch)
        
        # Add constraint penalties
        for j in {layer, head, hidden, int} do
            loss += λ_j(||z_j||_0 - k_j) + φ_j(||z_j||_0 - k_j)²
        
        # Backward pass
        grad = compute_gradients(loss)
        θ = θ - η∇_θ loss
        z = z - η∇_z loss
        
        # Update Lagrange multipliers
        for j in {layer, head, hidden, int} do
            λ_j += η_λ(||z_j||_0 - k_j)
```

### 4.3 Memory Optimizations

To handle the large model size, we implement several optimizations:

1. Gradient Checkpointing:
```python
model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()
```

2. Mixed Precision Training:
```python
with torch.cuda.amp.autocast(dtype=torch.bfloat16):
    outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask)
```

3. Memory Management:
```python
os.environ['PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF'] = 'expandable_segments:True'
```
